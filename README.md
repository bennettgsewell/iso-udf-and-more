# iso-udf-and-more

(2024 Work in Progress) Complete toolset for creating/modifying ISO 9660, UDF, Juliet, Rock Ridge

I'm starting this project 2024-08-08, feel free to join in and contribute! Unless I'm hit by a bus I'm quite active on GitHub.

I cannot find a comprehensive library that does every CD/DVD/Blu-Ray filesystem. The software that do support these systems, such as ImgBurn, seem to be closed source. I figure this is as good a time as any to learn Rust and help fill a hole. Maybe I'll succeed, maybe this will just be another project that dies.
